# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> ### Rust/Tide codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### WIP - this repo is as yet incomplete and still being implemented

The app will evolve as I experiment with nice ways to structure things. It's very minimal so far, but I intend to grow it to be a good reference for implementing an app in Tide.

For now, the collection of Postman tests serve as "acceptance tests" (see [https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/tree/master/api]). The testing story for tide is still evolving, but rust tests will be included when they can be.

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Rust/Tide** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Rust/Tide** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
